This README is about running the production version of loudify.

Look at the loudify script in the bin/ directory for more information.
Basically, the loudify script simply wgets an archive file containing
ansible playbooks and then runs them.

In order for this to work, an archive of the ansible scripts must be deployed
here:

http://loud.lcsee.wvu.edu/phonehome

Creating the archive thusly:

git archive --remote git@webgit.lcseecloud.net:ubuntu/loud-ubuntu-ansible.git --format tar --prefix=loud-ubuntu-ansible/ master | gzip > loud-ubuntu-ansible.tar.gz

Copying into place thusly

scp loud-ubuntu-ansible.tar.gz dmkrovich@loud.lcsee.wvu.edu:/srv/brone/phonehome

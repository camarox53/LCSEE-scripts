To aid with development a loudify.dev script has been placed in bin/

The loudify.dev script will not wget, it will expect the ansible
playbooks to already be in the correct location.  The loudify.dev
script will call the loudify-dev.yml playbook which will setup the
machine to key off of LCSEE mirror and loud repositories and setup a
development environment.  It will not bring in the rest of LOUD.


Recommended development workflow:

Setup virtual machine w/ 15.04 Ubuntu

apt-get install git

put ssh keys in place

Make a snapshot.

Copy and paste this line:
$ sudo mkdir -p /opt/loud/ansible && cd /opt/loud/ansible && git archive --remote git@webgit.lcseecloud.net:ubuntu/loud-ubuntu-ansible.git --format tar --prefix=loud-ubuntu-ansible/ master | sudo tar xvf -

run ansible playbooks:
$ sudo /opt/loud/ansible/loud-ubuntu-ansible/bin/loudify.dev

observe.

revert to snapshot.

repeat.
